=================

Hello everyone! We are publishing this month's newsletter a bit later than usual due to the recent festivities. We hope you all enjoyed a lovely Easter break and a happy Eid Mubarak.

**In this issue:**

- We share some of the highlights from our recent :ref:`**Research IT Forum** <research_it_forum>` event. 
- Storage Options Update: Learn about `available storage solutions <storage_options>` in light of new Google Drive policies. 
- **Expansion of the HPC Team:** Meet our newest team members, Angie and Becki who will be with us for the spring season.

Research IT Forum
-----------------

Our annual Research IT Forum, held on April 9th. It provided an excellent opportunity to celebrate and showcase the groundbreaking research projects taking place on HPC. A huge thank you to all the speakers and attendees who contributed to making this year's forum a success. For those who missed it, you can find all the `presentation slides here <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YPctycoYDaxZX4aqAqdCiQYQD9lgAtq_?usp=sharing>`_ . 
Also, a special thank you to Desmond Ryan and Carl Kennedy who were the key organisers this year.

Storage Options
---------------

Research Storage
++++++++++++++++

Recently, many of you received emails regarding Google Drive's new `15GB data cap <https://staff.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/storage/google-data-cap-project>`_, resulting from Google's 1PB limit on university data (we currently hold 2.97PB). To address this, we encourage users to :

- Delete any data that is no longer needed from their google drive.
- Migrate to our research storage solution (X-Drive), which offers up to 10TB of storage for research groups. This offers a secure, encrypted and backed up option to meet any Data storage and GDPR needs.  With access control it also facilitates collaboration and file-sharing among teams and accessible from any device that is connected to the university's VPN. Additionally, research storage can be made available on both Stanage and Bessemer upon request. It should also offer a performance boost over google drives, for users on campus or geographically close to Sheffield. Learn more about requesting or using research storage `here <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/storage>`_ (You will need to be logged in, to access the page).

FastData Storage
++++++++++++++++

This month we `Fastdata <https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/filestore.html#fastdata-areas>`_ on the HPC clusters. Fast data uses a parallel, distributed file system known as lustre. Its distributed nature allows us the following benefits:

- Scalability: It allows us to have large amount of storage and increase it overtime without affecting the pre-existing storage.
- Allows us to achieve parallel read and writes over the multiple CPUs and nodes your jobs are running on without taking a hit to latency or throughput.
- Reliability: Allows us fault tolerance and ensures data integrity and availability.

In our case it also allows us huge amounts of storage as **currently** there are no quotas compared to the home directory.

** All this benefit come at the price of fastdata being optimised for large file operations. They are faster than Home directories and Shared (project) directories when dealing with larger files but are not performant when reading/writing lots of small files as shown on the benchmarks shown `here <https://walkingrandomly.com/?p=6167>_` **

** The platform team also added the command ``show-fastdata-consumption`` which shows the total usage storage by all our users on fast data. For most users this can be a proactive way of checking if its time to do some housekeeping on the fast data directories. **

Licences
--------

For users of licensed software such as MATLAB and Ansys, please be mindful of license availability when submitting multiple jobs that will take huge fraction of licences from the pool. Please notify us in advance if you require a significant number of licenses or consider using `job dependency <https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/scheduler/advanced_job_submission_and_control.html#dependent-jobs-on-bessemer-and-stanage>`_ to manage license usage effectively.


New Packages and software
--------------------------

Check out the latest additions to Stanage:

- Apptainer version 1.3.0. This shouldn't result in any significant user-facing changes but please let us know if you notice any behaviour or significant performance changes, particularly relating to filesystem performance.
- Nextflow version 23.10.0


JADE2 has now been upgraded from RHEL 7.x to RHEL 8.9. Its NVIDIA libraries and tools have also been upgraded too. 


For users using Pytorch and the GPUs to carry out experiments, using a newer Pytorch container (24.02 rather than 23.07) should fix a bug which made the H100 PCIE slower than the A100. You should see an almost 50% performance boost between the two Pytorch versions as discovered by the benchmarks Peter Haywood ran. Performance on the A100 stays the same.
